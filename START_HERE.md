- Make sure they're in the right folders
- Open a GIF directly in browser to test

### Problem: Page looks broken
**Solution:**
- Make sure all 3 files exist: index.html, style.css, script.js
- Don't move or rename these files
- Try a different browser

### Problem: Don't know which GIFs to choose
**Solution:**
- Just pick the FIRST one you see on GIPHY
- You can always change it later
- Any heart GIF will work!

## 💡 PRO TIPS

✅ **Start with 6 GIFs:** Get the page working first, add more later
✅ **Test on phone:** That's probably where she'll see it
✅ **Save backups:** Keep original files just in case
✅ **Preview mode:** Open index.html anytime to see your progress
✅ **Take breaks:** Spending 2 hours is fine! Make it perfect.
