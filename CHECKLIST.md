## 🎯 MINIMUM VIABLE PROPOSAL

**Don't have time for everything?** Here's the bare minimum:

1. ✅ Download 6 critical GIFs (heart1-4, rose, hero-heart)
2. ✅ Change her name (line 54 in index.html)
3. ✅ Change anniversary date (line 7 in script.js)
4. ✅ Open index.html → Show her!

**You can always add more later!**

---

## 💡 TIPS

- **Start simple:** Get the critical GIFs working first, add the rest later
- **Test as you go:** Open index.html after every change to see progress
- **Mobile first:** Check on phone - that's probably where she'll see it
- **Backup plan:** Save to USB drive in case internet fails
- **Privacy:** Don't share the link publicly if you use real names/photos

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### GIFs not showing?
1. Check file names match EXACTLY (case-sensitive!)
2. Make sure they're in the right folders
3. Try opening a GIF directly in browser to test path

### Page looks broken?
1. Make sure all 3 files exist: index.html, style.css, script.js
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
3. Try a different browser

### Music not playing?
1. Browser might block autoplay - click the music button manually
2. Make sure file is named exactly `music.mp3`
3. Some formats might not work - use MP3

## 🎉 YOU'RE READY!

Once all critical items are checked, you're good to go!

**Remember:** She's going to love it because YOU made it for HER. The effort and thoughtfulness is what matters most! 💖

Good luck! 🍀
